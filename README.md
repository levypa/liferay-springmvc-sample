# A sample Spring MVC portlet for Liferay 7

Just a basic portlet build with [Spring Portlet MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/portlet.html). The module can be build with both [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

The base for the portlet was generated using the [maven archetype](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/generating-new-projects-using-archetypes) as provided by [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com)

The following modifications or additions have been added on top of the generated code:
* Upgraded the Spring version to 4.3.10-RELEASE
* First name of the user is added in the hello message

More coming soon!
